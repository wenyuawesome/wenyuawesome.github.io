		<h2> Here, I keep memories; pictures of me and friends having F.U.N.</h2>
		<p> Me and Patrick went to Glove World last week. Look at the cool balloons we got! </p>

		<p> Last Valentine's Day I tried to be Squidward's Valentine. He said no. It's okay though because I know he said that out of the goodness of his heart. <3 </p>

		<p> All the citizens of Bikini Bottom came together and took this big fabulous family picture! </p>

		<p> Me, Patrick and Squidward made a club called the 'Feathered Friends'. This picture makes it clear that we always have fun together. </p>

		<p> Me, Mom, Dad, and Patrick all went on this super fun raod trip together. We sang the best raod trip songs the whole way there!</p>
